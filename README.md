# 💼 LinkedIn Post Examples

This repository contains hands-on code examples that accompany my LinkedIn technical posts. The goal is to provide developers with **practical, real-world code snippets and mini-projects** that demonstrate concepts I write about in short form on LinkedIn.

Each folder is dedicated to a specific post or series, with step-by-step code to help you follow along more deeply.

## 📁 Structure

```

## 🚀 Featured Example

### 🔹 [`fastapi_docker_example`](./python/fastapi_docker_example)

This is a **minimal Dockerized FastAPI app** demonstrating how to:

- Write a simple FastAPI application
- Containerize it using Docker
- Use Docker Compose to manage the container
- Access the app at `http://localhost:8000`

📌 This example is part of my **5-part Docker series** on LinkedIn and the blog. It’s designed for developers who are new to Docker and want to learn how to containerize Python web applications with minimal setup.

## 📌 Why This Repo Exists

I use LinkedIn to share concise technical posts, but sometimes code examples need a bit more space and structure. This repository serves as a home for that **extra context and working code**.

If you're following my posts and want to go deeper—this is the place!

## 🛠️ Upcoming Examples

- Docker Networking & Volumes
- Deploying Docker Apps to the Cloud
